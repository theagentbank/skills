# Recipients and wallets

## Saved recipients

Call `list_recipients`, reuse only a clear rail-and-fields match, and call
`get_recipient` for complete fields. Ask the human to choose if multiple
records match. `verified=false` alone does not make a recipient invalid.

## New recipient data

When the human supplies an image, QR payload, pasted bank text, account
details, or structured bank data, call `create_recipient` before estimating or
creating a payment. Use the returned `recipient_id` or canonical
`recipient_fields`; never manually copy unvalidated fields.

For local stdio, an image can use absolute `image.path`; remote clients use
`image.data_base64`. QR images must contain a readable QR. Pass text-only
screenshots as visible `pasted_text` or `bank_info`.

For `information_required`, ask only for listed missing or invalid fields. Keep
the request ID only if the payload is unchanged; use a new one after a change.

Use `update_recipient` only after the human confirms replacement fields. It
creates a replacement record and does not revoke the old one.

## Wallets

For an on-ramp to the shared wallet, call `list_wallets` and use the active
Worldchain address. Never request its private key.

Call `get_wallet_balances` before a crypto deposit or swap instruction. Include
the native balance because a non-AgentKit-verified Privy EOA pays its own gas.

`get_token_allowance` reads allowance. `approve_token` is a compatibility
utility and is not part of the normal payment flow; Core performs exact
approval when required by `execute_payment_instruction`.

`get_transaction_receipt` can resolve a wallet submission, but cannot make a
payment successful. Continue to trust `get_payment`.
